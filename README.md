An experience driven text editor I'm in the middle of creating. It's heavily informed by my ideas about subverting user expectations, and is inspired by (among other things) Windows95tips.com, HAL, and Clippy.

More focused on creating an experience than functionality. Right now it functions as a simple .txt editor, allowing one to save, load and create new documents. Basic functionality is added for events, athough none of them are in their final form. I still need to add word count functionality and a focus listener.

Eventually it will add events that will be fired after a certain number of words typed, or a certain amount of time without words having been typed. These events will originally be pretty uninteresting- (cat pictures, celebratory horns, congratulatory text, a slight scolding, or frowny face) - but will eventually become more and more menacing (threats, unnerving music and pictures, creepily clingly love notes, almost un-ending popups) until they culminate in the users work being vandalized, saved over, and eventually totally deleted.
